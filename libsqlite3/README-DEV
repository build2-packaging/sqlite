This document describes how the libsqlite3 library was packaged for build2. In
particular, this understanding will be useful when upgrading to a new upstream
version. See ../README-DEV for general notes on SQLite packaging.

Symlink the required upstream files into libsqlite3/:

$ ln -s ../../upstream/{sqlite3.c,sqlite3ext.h,sqlite3.h} libsqlite3

Patch ../upstream/sqlite3.c to fix warnings that pop up with -Wall (see
../upstream/sqlite3.c.patch for details).
