This document describes the approach applied to packaging SQLite for build2. In
particular, this understanding will be useful when upgrading to a new upstream
version.

The upstream package contains the libsqlite3 library and the sqlite3 program
that we package separately (see the respective README-DEV files for details).

We extract the upstream package from the archive and symlink the required files
into the build2 package subdirectories.

For 3.18.2, that we packaged initially, the archive URL is
https://www.sqlite.org/2017/sqlite-autoconf-3180200.tar.gz. For the future
releases the URL can be deduced from the above.
